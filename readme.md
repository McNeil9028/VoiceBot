#This is VoiceBot.
It creates an extra voice channel for people to join at all times. If general is occupied it cretes general 1. IF general n is occupied it creates gneeral n+1.
Works for all channels and coppies the channels settings.

## The original channel must NOT end with a number. Channels with numbers at the end get deleted.
## Run the bot when no one is in a channel to avoid errors. Once run people can join and leave as they please.
